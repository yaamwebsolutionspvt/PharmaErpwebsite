              <h2>12. Dispute Resolution</h2>

              <h3>12.1 Informal Resolution</h3>
              <p>Before filing a claim, please contact us at legal@mediyaam.com to attempt to resolve the
                dispute informally. We'll work in good faith to reach a mutually acceptable resolution.</p>

              <h3>12.2 Arbitration Agreement</h3>
              <p>If we can't resolve a dispute informally, you agree that any dispute will be resolved through
                binding arbitration rather than in court, except that either party may seek injunctive relief in
                court for intellectual property infringement or unauthorized access to the Service.</p>
              <p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration
                Association's Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding.</p>

              <h3>12.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
              <p>YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO
                PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>

              <h3>12.4 Governing Law</h3>
              <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without regard to conflict of law

              <h3>13.2 Amendments</h3>
              <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. We'll notify you of material changes via email
                or in-app notification at least 30 days before they take effect. Your continued use of the Service
                after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.</p>

              <h3>13.3 Severability</h3>
              <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions

              <h3>13.4 Waiver</h3>
              <p>Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms doesn't constitute a waiver of that provision
                or any other provision.</p>

              <h3>13.5 Assignment</h3>
              <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your account without our prior written consent.

              <h3>13.6 Force Majeure</h3>
              <p>Neither party will be liable for failure to perform due to causes beyond reasonable control,
